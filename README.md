# casino
a web based all in one casino

Reason for making:
I wanted to experimaent with making a backend chat app, but didn't want to make it so boring so,
I decied on making a casino game!

The way I see it a casino website is simply a caht room website because
it connects multiple people into one "room" and exchanges infromation between machines via a web socket(typically)

I also haven't found a good and acessable website that is a true one stop place for online casino fun!

Of course this project will not use actuall money, althoiugh I might introduce micro trasations to buy chips and card skins for fuina dn practice with stripe later opn in development
